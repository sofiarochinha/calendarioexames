abstract = {The electronic calendar is a common tool used by large numbers of people to reflect
and shape their daily activities. It's function and structure is rooted in legacy
representations dating back thousands of years. Collaborating with designers and engineers
our project seeks to re-consider what the calendar does for us and how we may perceive
and represent our time, personally and collectively. This paper investigates the background
to 'the calendar problem' and documents design-led research. Seeking to identify some
of the key problems with the current representation and to establish criteria for
new interpretations of the meaning of calendar.},
